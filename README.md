# Poker

This is a single-player poker game. Once the player's 5-card hand is dealt, they have
the opportunity to replace any of their cards with new ones picked from the deck.
Then they are awarded points based on their hand as follows:

Royal Flush: 250 points
Straight Flush: 200 points
Four of a kind: 100 points
Full House: 30 points
Flush: 25 points
Straight: 20 points
Three of a kind: 15 points
Two Pair: 10 points
One Pair: 5 points

Lightweight, fun, and user friendly :)
